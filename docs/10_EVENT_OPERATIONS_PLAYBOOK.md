## Purpose

This playbook defines how a Databricks Quest GameDay is planned, configured, dry-run, delivered, and followed up.

## Event lifecycle

Plan → Configure → Dry-run → Launch → Play → Freeze → Debrief → Export → Reset
```

## 1. Plan

### Define event purpose

Choose one:

- internal enablement
- customer workshop
- hunter account activation
- conference/event booth
- partner enablement
- product launch enablement

### Define success criteria

Examples:

- 80% of teams complete the first three quests
- every team creates a governed table and AI/BI dashboard
- at least five prospect champions complete the GenAI challenge
- collect top blockers for future enablement

### Choose quest pack

Start with one of:

- Lakehouse Foundations
- AI/BI GameDay
- GenAI/RAG on Databricks
- Unity Catalog Governance
- Lakeflow Data Engineering
- Cost/Performance Optimization

## 2. Configure

Host actions:

1. Deploy/update Databricks Quest.
2. Import quest pack manifest.
3. Create event.
4. Set event time window.
5. Configure scoring rules.
6. Import participants.
7. Create or auto-generate teams.
8. Configure team resource namespace.
9. Run environment prechecks.
10. Seed required datasets.

## 3. Dry-run

A dry-run is mandatory before external/customer events.

Dry-run checklist:

- Quest pack lints cleanly.
- All validators parse correctly.
- SQL Warehouse is reachable.
- App can connect to Lakebase.
- Team schemas/catalogs can be created.
- Seed data exists.
- Sample pass/fail submissions behave correctly.
- Leaderboard updates.
- Host controls work.
- Reset works.

## 4. Launch

Opening briefing agenda:

1. Welcome and event objective.
2. Story narrative.
3. Team format.
4. Rules and scoring.
5. Hint penalty explanation.
6. Support model.
7. Leaderboard and final reveal.
8. Start event.

Recommended rules:

- Teams may use documentation and AI assistants unless event rules say otherwise.
- Hints are allowed but cost points.
- Host decisions are final.
- Do not intentionally disrupt other teams.
- Use only assigned team resources.
- Submissions after freeze do not count.

## 5. Play

Host actions during gameplay:

- monitor validation queue
- monitor teams with no progress
- issue announcements
- identify broken validators
- handle manual reviews
- prepare debrief examples
- avoid over-helping unless teams are blocked

Support pattern:

- Ask questions before giving answers.
- Use hints rather than direct steps.
- Encourage team role division.
- Keep energy high with leaderboard moments.

## 6. Freeze

At event end:

1. Host clicks Freeze.
2. New submissions are blocked.
3. Pending validations finish.
4. Manual adjudications are applied.
5. Final leaderboard is calculated.

## 7. Debrief

Debrief structure:

1. Final leaderboard reveal.
2. Winning team approach.
3. Common failure patterns.
4. Databricks best-practice recap.
5. Business outcome mapping.
6. Next steps.

For hunter accounts, explicitly connect outcomes to deal strategy:

- Which pains did they experience?
- Which Databricks capabilities unlocked progress?
- Who emerged as champions?
- Which use cases need follow-up?

## 8. Export

Export artifacts:

- event summary
- team leaderboard
- quest completion matrix
- validation failure summary
- hint usage
- team participation
- skill coverage
- top blockers
- sales follow-up notes

## 9. Reset

After event:

- archive event
- export results
- reset or drop team schemas
- revoke temporary grants
- stop unused warehouses/jobs
- clean generated endpoints/resources
- preserve audit tables

## Event staffing model

### Small event: 10–25 people

- 1 host
- 1 technical facilitator

### Medium event: 25–75 people

- 1 host
- 2–3 technical facilitators
- 1 ops person

### Large event: 75–300 people

- 1 lead host
- 1 event ops lead
- 4–8 facilitators
- 1 platform admin
- 1 support channel moderator

## Event communication template

```text
Welcome to Databricks Quest GameDay.

Today you are part of a team solving a realistic data and AI challenge on Databricks. This is not a step-by-step lab. Your team will decide how to solve the missions, submit your work for validation, and earn points as you progress.

Use the Quest app to view missions, request hints, validate your work, and track the leaderboard. Hints cost points. The event will freeze at the end of the timer, and the final leaderboard will be revealed during the debrief.
```
