"""Data-access repositories for GameDay Event Mode.

Each repository owns reads/writes for one slice of the domain and is the only
place that should contain SQL for that slice. Read paths degrade gracefully
(return empty/None) when Lakebase is unavailable, mirroring adoption mode.

These are foundational stubs introduced in PR01. Mutation paths that require
auditing, transactions, or validation are intentionally deferred to later PRs
and raise ``NotImplementedError`` until then.
