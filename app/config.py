"""Runtime configuration for Databricks Quest — the single mode switch.

There is exactly one codebase and one build artifact. Standalone vs
multi-workspace, and master vs child, are selected purely by runtime
parameters (env vars set from ``deploy.sh`` flags). This module reads them
**once at import** so every other module shares the same view.

Two orthogonal switches:

``QUEST_EVENT_MODE`` — the master GameDay kill-switch. **Off by default.** When
off, the deployment is the legacy platform-adoption app and *nothing* GameDay is
exposed: the Event-Mode API routers 404 and the Event UI is hidden. GameDay must
be opted into explicitly (``--event-mode`` / ``QUEST_EVENT_MODE=on``). A
``master`` or ``child`` role implies Event Mode (a federated deploy is inherently
an event), so it is forced on for those roles.

``QUEST_ROLE`` — federation topology, only meaningful when Event Mode is on:

- ``standalone`` (default) — single-workspace app against its own local
  Lakebase. With Event Mode off this is the legacy adoption app; with Event Mode
  on it is a single-workspace GameDay. Federation paths are dormant.
- ``master`` — runs against the shared Lakebase it owns; hosts the console,
  reports, roster/identity map, and provisions the event-writer credential.
- ``child`` — runs gameplay + validation locally but reads/writes the master's
  shared Lakebase (scoped by ``QUEST_WORKSPACE_ID``).

Everything else (Lakebase host, writer credential, event slug, workspace id) is
an independent parameter, so the same image can be re-pointed at a different
master/event without a rebuild.
