# MAGIC # Databricks Quest - Scoring Pipeline
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Reads system tables, detects mission completions, computes user profiles,
# MAGIC leaderboards, badges, and notifications. Idempotent via MERGE.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Human activity only (no automation double-counting)
# MAGIC Quest is a *human* adoption game. `system.billing.usage.identity_metadata.run_as`
# MAGIC logs whoever a workload runs *as* — for a scheduled job or continuous pipeline
# MAGIC that is the creator, not a person at the keyboard. So a cron job or DLT pipeline
# MAGIC keeps banking points under its owner's name even while they're on leave, which
# MAGIC inflates the leaderboard (verified on real data: ~79% of consumption DBUs come
# MAGIC from job/pipeline rows).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The rule this pipeline enforces:
# MAGIC   * **Creating** an automated workload is rewarded **once** (Job Creator,
# MAGIC     Pipeline Builder, Scheduler, Multi-Task Orchestrator, Auto Loader Pioneer —
# MAGIC     each keyed on the first `creator`/`created_by` event, so it fires a single
# MAGIC     time regardless of how often the workload later runs).
# MAGIC   * **Ongoing consumption / activity** points count **interactive human work
# MAGIC     only**. Billing rows carrying a `job_id` or `dlt_pipeline_id` are automated
# MAGIC     and excluded (`INTERACTIVE_USAGE` filter below). Run-based missions count
# MAGIC     only human-triggered runs (`trigger_type` = ONETIME for jobs / USER_ACTION
# MAGIC     for pipelines). Query-count missions exclude job/pipeline-sourced queries.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Column names verified against the official system-tables reference and live data.

# COMMAND ----------

# Reusable predicate: a system.billing.usage row is INTERACTIVE (human at the
# keyboard) when it is not attributed to a scheduled job run or a pipeline update.
# usage_metadata.job_id / dlt_pipeline_id are populated only for automated compute.
INTERACTIVE_USAGE = (
    "usage_metadata.job_id IS NULL AND usage_metadata.dlt_pipeline_id IS NULL"
)

# Products that represent a HUMAN actively driving compute, used for the weekly
# DBU consumption points. This is an ALLOW-list (not an exclude-list) on purpose:
# always-on / machine products must not leak into a human adoption leaderboard,
# and an allow-list means a NEW machine product can't silently start counting.
#   ALL_PURPOSE  - interactive clusters (notebooks/REPL)
#   INTERACTIVE  - serverless interactive notebooks/SQL
#   SQL          - SQL warehouse queries (editor/dashboards)
#   AI_FUNCTIONS - a person invoking ai_query() etc.
#   GENIE        - a person asking questions in Genie
# Deliberately EXCLUDED (machine / always-on, even when job_id is null):
#   MODEL_SERVING (inference endpoints answer requests 24/7 — this was letting an
#   endpoint owner top the leaderboard on ~369k DBUs of automated inference),
#   DATA_QUALITY_MONITORING, AGENT_EVALUATION, FEATURE_STORE, VECTOR_SEARCH,
#   LAKEBASE, AI_GATEWAY, etc. Deploying a model / serving are still rewarded via
#   the model_deployer and ml_practitioner missions, just not this raw DBU pool.
INTERACTIVE_PRODUCTS = ('ALL_PURPOSE', 'INTERACTIVE', 'SQL', 'AI_FUNCTIONS', 'GENIE')

# Safety cap: no single user can bank more than this many DBU-consumption points
# in one week, so raw compute volume alone can never dominate the human-adoption
# leaderboard even within the interactive products.

#   * Model Serving — a person exercising an endpoint they own.
# The INTERACTIVE_USAGE filter drops scheduled job/pipeline compute so an
# on-leave owner's cron can't keep earning.
#
# NOTE: the old "Job Runner" (JOBS DBUs) and "Pipeline Operator" (DLT DBUs)
# consumption missions were removed. Jobs/DLT compute is automated by
# definition (every row carries a job_id / dlt_pipeline_id), so those missions
# rewarded "each time the workload runs" — exactly what we don't want. Setting
# up those workloads is already a one-time award (Job Creator, Pipeline
# Builder), which is where the "reward first-time setup" credit belongs.

# These missions exclude *scheduled job* compute (job_id) but NOT dlt_pipeline_id.
# Reason: serverless SQL warehouse billing rows spuriously carry a dlt_pipeline_id
# even for ordinary interactive editor/dashboard queries, so the full
# INTERACTIVE_USAGE predicate (which also excludes dlt_pipeline_id) wrongly zeroed
# out SQL Analyst. Excluding only job_id is the correct human-vs-automation split
# for these product-consumption missions (verified: 0 -> 65 SQL Analyst qualifiers).
